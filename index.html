I was born in Brussels, Belgium and grew up there until I finished highschool. I then moved to Israel and lived there for 8 years. During this time, I went to a school of talmudic studies for a little over a year, served in the IDF as a paratrooper and completed my degree of Aerospace Engineering at Technion. I have three sisters and a little brother called Motti; you can see him in the picture. <br /><br /></p>
